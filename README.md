## Multi Agent Pathfinding Problem using Conflict Based Search (CBS) and its applications in Agriculture

Multi-agent pathfinding algorithm is responsible for finding the paths for multiple agents from their current locations to their target locations without colliding with each other, while at the same time optimizing a global cost function, such as the sum of the path lengths of all agents. 


The problem is formulated by giving the input for the coordinates of the source and the destinations, with the obstacles given as the points that cannot be accessed by the robots. We assume the workhouse as a matrix with the coordinates representing the desired location.

The path of the robots in which the cell are in normal state, only one robot can exist in that cell. We develop an algorithm to get the tasks done in the minimum time possible. The methodology is discussed in further detail ![here](https://github.com/jainaviral898/mapp-cbs-aifa/blob/main/AIFA%20Term%20Assignment.pdf).

## Input Format

Use the input_format.yaml file to give the inputs, fill in the stops made by the robots.

The obstacles are to be included in the given format.
